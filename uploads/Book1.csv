Functional end to end warning system connects those who need to hear messages to others who compile and track the hazard information.",,,,,,,,,
# of people participating in interventions that enhance their capacity to face shocks and stresses (KRI),"According to DG ECHO Definition (KRI): Interventions at household and local level aimed at concretely strengthen the capacity.

DREF for imminent crisis allocations, are DREF request that are processed and completed before the impact (or the peak) of an event. ",,,,,,,,,
# of people whose livelihoods and assets are protected from shocks and stresses (KRI),"Livelihoods comprise the capabilities, assets and activities required for generating income and securing means of living. The focus here is on activities related to production and income generation.
Assets focus on “productive” assets. Productive assets are physical resources (e.g. tools, equipment, female or draft animals, agricultural land, rental properties, etc.) that increase the household’s labor productivity and production thereby enabling it to increase its income, food security and other livelihood outcomes over time.
Shocks are “external short-term deviations from long term trends that have substantial negative effects on people’s current state of well-being, level of assets, livelihoods, safety or their ability to withstand future shocks”. Shocks can be slow onset like drought, or relatively rapid onset like flooding, disease outbreak, or market fluctuations. Stresses are “long-term trends or pressures that undermine the stability of a system and increase vulnerability within it”. Stresses could include factors such as population pressure, climate variability, chronic poverty, persistent discrimination, and protracted crises like intergroup conflict. 
Examples of activities related to climate-smart livelihoods:
1.	Supporting smallholder farmers to access and plant drought tolerant and shorter duration crop varieties (short adaptation through climate risk management)
2.	Support climate smart farming/production practices – e.g. intercropping, soil and water management through for example cover crops or mulching, trenching, vegetation barriers, organic farming, key-hold gardens
3.	Responsible harvesting of natural products
4.	Supporting integrated production systems – crops-forests components (agrosilvicultural systems), forests-livestock components (silvopastoral systems), and crops-forest-livestock components (agrosilvopastoral systems). 
5.	Supporting micro and small businesses or smallholder farmers to access finance and knowledge for the adoption of clean and appropriate technologies (e.g. solar panels and dryers, drip irrigation, water efficient processing equipment, etc.) that increase climate resiliency and preserve ecosystems upon which rural livelihoods depend
6.	Facilitation of access to climate-smart advisory and index-based microinsurance
7.	Awareness-raising/sensitization on or skills development in climate smart production and income-generation
8.	Complementing activities around the adoption of climate-smart production and income-generating practices by socioeconomically vulnerable households with anticipatory, seasonal or one-off safety net (e.g. cash transfers)",,,,,,,,,
# of National Societies with coordinated early action and contingency plans with DRM authorities ,"Anticipatory actions are a set of actions taken to prevent or mitigate potential disaster impacts before a shock or before acute impacts are felt. The actions are carried out in anticipation of a hazard impact and based on a prediction of how the event will unfold. Anticipatory actions should not be a substitute for longer-term investment in risk reduction and should aim to strengthen people’s capacity to manage risks.
Contingency planning takes please when there is a specific threat or hazard identified. A contingency plan sets out the scale of the response, the resources needed, and the practical management tasks that will be needed for possible scenarios within a specific context. This planning can be found in NS multi-hazard response plans, with hazard specific annexes, or several hazard specific contingency plans to cover high-risk disaster events.
A NS role and planned response should be recognized by respective authorities and governments.",,,,,,,,,
# of National Societies adopting greening practices to improve the environmental sustainability of their operations,"Greening practices has no firm definition, however it covers a number of features that indicate environmental sustainability (E.S.) has been improved in some way. This includes: formal commitment of the NS to E.S. through development of an environmental policy, or inclusion of E.S. in their long-term Strategy; NS has developed an environmental management plan, or measured their environmental and carbon footprints; changes to supply chain management or other logistics functions that reduce environmental footprint (reducing carbon emissions, waste, improved sustainability of emergency stocks etc); NS has developed capacity to assess environmental risks of their programmes and operations (environmental screening) and/or piloted environmental screening; sectoral interventions have integrated use of clean energy, improved waste management, protection of local natural resources.",,,,,,,,,
% of community members who know key practices to prevent epidemic disease spread,"Through programme activities 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, community members learn how to prevent the spread of priority diseases. Knowledge Attitudes and Practices (KAP) surveys organised at the start and at the end of the programme will assess the extent to which target communities are able to identify key practices to prevent the spread of priority diseases in their country. ",,,,,,,,,
"# of people reached with epidemic preparedness, and health literacy information at community level","Through programme activities 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, the National Society organises activities designed to share information about epidemic preparedness with targeted communities. These can for instance include household visits, group information sessions or mobile cinema. Activities can target specific groups, such as families with young children requiring immunization, school children and teachers, traditional healers, religious leaders, animal health workers, the media, community-based organisations in charge of water and sanitation, or private sector actors.  
Do not include people reached through radio/TV programmes and social media who can only be estimated. Double-counting is likely to happen as the same people can take part in more than one activity.",,,,,,,,,
"# of people reached by National Societies with contextually appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene services","Water services refer to activities that increase the quantity and quality of water for supported populations. It includes activities such as establishment or rehabilitation of water supply infrastructure, distribution of safe water or the provision of household water treatment materials accompanied by training in their use and post distribution monitoring.  
Sanitation services refer to activities that increase the quantity and quality of excreta disposal facilities for supported populations. It includes activities such as construction or rehabilitation of toilets that are female and disability friendly and the management of the human waste chain (storage, removal, transport and disposal). Sanitation services also includes environmental sanitation activities such as drainage, solid waste management and vector control.
Hygiene services refer to promotion of improved hygiene behaviour and the provision of materials for improved hygiene. It includes activities such as hygiene promotion campaigns, encouragement of proper use of water and sanitation facilities and distribution of hygiene materials, including materials for menstrual hygiene management.",,,,,,,,,
% of community-based surveillance (CBS) alerts responded to within 24 hours ,"Community-based surveillance (or CBS) is the systematic detection and reporting of public health risks with epidemic potential by trained RCRC volunteers. CBS is a different approach than contact tracing/ line listing, rumour tracking, PoE, community engagement or call centers. The purpose of CBS is to improve early detection of health risks within the communities they emerge, facilitating a more rapid and targeted response. Timliness of the system is essential. The proportion of alerts responded to within 24 hours gives an indication on the timeliness of the system.",,,,,,,,,
# of Red Cross Red Crescent health facilities (with their attached population reached) that have conducted an infection prevention and control (IPC) assessment,"Through programme activity 2.6, the National Society increases its capacity to prepare for and respond to health emergencies. This includes strengthening the health services it manages. 

Conducting infection prevention and control (IPC) assessments of National Society managed health facilities (hospitals, clinics, outpatient care centers and specialized care centers) provides useful information to identify key strengths and weaknesses that need to be addressed. For large facilities, it is recommended to use the Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Framework at the facility level (IPCAF, available online: https://www.who.int/infection-prevention/tools/core-components/IPCAF-facility.PDF) or other tools recommended by the Ministry of Health. Small facilities can use simplified assessments, which should be discussed with the Ministry of Health. IFRC can provide technical guidance if required. 

Planning various assessments of each facility allows National Societies to assess progress over time. 
Only include the number of health facilities managed by the National Society as this indicator is related to National Society preparedness. Each facility is only counted once, even if several assessments are conducted in the same facility over time.",,,,,,,,,
